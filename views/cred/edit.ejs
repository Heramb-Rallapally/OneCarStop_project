            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ensuring your vehicle has a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate is a critical step in promoting environmental sustainability. PUC certificates help monitor and control vehicular emissions, 
                ensuring they remain within permissible limits.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">By adhering to these standards, we can significantly reduce air pollution,
                 which is a major contributor to respiratory diseases and environmental degradation.
                  Regular PUC checks encourage vehicle owners to maintain their engines properly, leading to better fuel efficiency and reduced carbon footprints.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Embracing PUC not only complies with legal requirements but also reflects our commitment to a
                 healthier planet, fostering a cleaner, greener future for generations to come.</p>
